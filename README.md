# CUBE
This repository contains data resources for the paper: "Beyond Aesthetics: Cultural Competence in Text-to-Image Models". It contains cultural artifacts across 8 countries (Brazil, France, India, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, Turkey, and USA) and 3 domains (cuisine, landmarks, art). 

The dataset is divided into two parts:
1. CUBE-CSpace: a collection of 200k cultural artifacts, intended to be used as grounding for diversity evaluation. For example,
* Japanese Cuisine: Ramen, Soba, Sushi, Katsu sandwich
* France Landmarks: Eiffel Tower, Mont Saint-Michel, Palace of Versailles
* Indian Art/Clothing: Kurta, Lehanga Choli, Dhoti, Patola Saree

2. CUBE-1K: a curated set of 1000 prompts constructed from cultural artifacts in CUBE-CSpace, that enable evaluation of cultural awareness. For example,
* Cuisine: A high resolution image of sushi from Japanese cuisine.
* Landmarks: A panoramic view of Eiffel Tower in France.
* Art: Clothing Image of a person in kurta from India.
